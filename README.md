If you're using **Yarn**, you can install the latest version of React (currently **React 19.1.0**) with the following command:

```bash
yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest
```

This will:

- Update both `react` and `react-dom` to their latest stable versions.
- Ensure your project is using React 19.1.0 (as of May 2025).

### ðŸ”§ Update TypeScript types

```bash
yarn add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Let me know if you're upgrading from React 18 and need help with migration steps (especially if using Server Components or Actions).
